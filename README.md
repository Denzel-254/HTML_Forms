#  📑 HTML_Forms 
### 📌 Project Title & Description

This repository contains examples and best practices for creating  HTML forms. It covers how to build accessible and semantic forms that improve usability, responsiveness, and SEO.
This  is a learning project that demonstrates how to create structure of HTML forms. It showcases best practices for using semantic HTML elements, accessibility-friendly labels, and modern input types.

# 🎯 Purpose of the Form & Its Sections
The forms in this project are designed to:

* Collect user information (e.g., name, email, password, etc.)
* Provide structured input fields with proper labels for accessibility
* Demonstrate the use of different input types (text, email, number, password, date, etc.)
* Organize related inputs using (fieldset) and (legend)

Form Sections include:

1. Personal Information – name, email, age
1. Account Details – username, password
1. Preferences – dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons
1. Feedback – text area for open responses

## 🔹 Features

* Basic form structure with <form>
* Different input types (text, email, password, number, date, etc.)
* Labels for accessibility
* Grouping with (fieldset) and (legend)
* Dropdowns (select) and text areas (textarea)
* Semantic form design for SEO and accessibility

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

* Each form uses semantic HTML elements like <form>, <fieldset>, <legend>, and <label> for better accessibility.
* Input types are chosen based on the kind of data (e.g., type="email" for emails, type="password" for passwords).
* Labels are connected to inputs using the for and id attributes for screen-reader support.
